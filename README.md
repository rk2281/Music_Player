# Music_Player
A music player system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
User Interactions:
The music player empowers users with seamless control over their audio experience. Through intuitive play, stop, and mute functionalities, users can effortlessly navigate through various songs. This not only enhances user engagement but also provides a dynamic and responsive interface.

Index-Based Selection:
The incorporation of event listener functions for index-based song selection is a testament to your thoughtful design. Enabling users to effortlessly choose their desired song enhances the overall usability and personalization of the music player.

Search Navbar:
The addition of a search navbar elevates the project's usability by enabling users to find songs quickly and efficiently. Your implementation of case-insensitive search, powered by an array and a forEach loop, exemplifies an elegant solution. The use of if-else conditional statements adds a layer of sophistication, ensuring a seamless and error-free user experience.
